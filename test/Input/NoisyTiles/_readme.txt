I have just uploaded another dataset to the same location I previously loaded the tiles.  This dataset is the exact same tiles (same shifts for ideal alignment), but now each tile has had a Gaussian background illumination added, as well as shot noise introduced.  The original image that these tiles were cut from had some level of shot noise too, but this should at least change the noise pattern.  I am more interested to see how the background illumination affects things.  It is not centered at the center of the image or any of the corners, so extra credit if you can figure out the center of the illumination.
